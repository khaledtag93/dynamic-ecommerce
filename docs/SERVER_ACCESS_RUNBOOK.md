# Server Access Runbook

This runbook exists because the project owner prefers explicit reminders for server operations and should not be expected to remember SSH/deploy commands.

## Rule for every server task
Always guide the owner from the very beginning:
1. Open Windows PowerShell.
2. Paste the SSH command.
3. Explain any first-connection prompt.
4. Explain that the SSH password is typed invisibly.
5. Wait until the shell prompt appears.
6. Only then provide the next command(s), one small step at a time.
7. Never assume the owner remembers previous server commands.

## Current known Hostinger SSH access
Historical/current known command:

```bash
ssh -p 65002 u637857322@145.79.20.185
```

If this command stops working, verify the current SSH host, username, and port from Hostinger before changing anything.

## First connection
If PowerShell shows:

```text
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

enter:

```text
yes
```

Then enter the current SSH password. The password will not be displayed while typing. Never store the password in this repository or documentation.

A successful login should end at a prompt similar to:

```text
u637857322@...:~$
```

At that point, stop and continue with the task-specific instructions.

## Production paths
Laravel application:

```text
/home/u637857322/domains/tag-marketplace.com/laravel_app
```

Public webroot:

```text
/home/u637857322/domains/tag-marketplace.com/public_html
```

## Safety
- Never ask the owner to paste secrets into Git or repository files.
- Never use `git push -f origin main` as part of the normal workflow.
- Never delete/reinitialize `.git` on the production server as a normal deploy step.
- Do not run migrations or deploy scripts until the current task explicitly reaches that stage.
- Keep `main` / production untouched until the release gate is approved.


### Production server discovery — 2026-09-20
- SSH login to Hostinger succeeded.
- The historical application path `/home/u637857322/domains/tag-marketplace.com/laravel_app` exists.
- Running `git status --short --branch` inside that directory returned: `fatal: not a git repository`.
- Therefore the current production Laravel directory is not a Git worktree. Do not run fetch/pull/reset/checkout there until the actual deployment layout is inspected and a safe migration/rehearsal plan is chosen.


### Production filesystem inspection — 2026-09-20
At `/home/u637857322/domains/tag-marketplace.com/laravel_app`:
- Laravel application files are present, including `artisan`, `composer.json`, `vendor/`, `storage/`, `.env`, `deploy.sh`, and `rollback.sh`.
- No `.git/` directory is present; this is a deployed file snapshot, not a Git checkout.
- Most application files are dated around 2026-04-17, while `.env` is server-local.
- Do not convert this live production directory into a Git worktree in place before a controlled rehearsal/backup plan.
- Preferred next step: inspect server runtime/tooling and free space, then prepare a separate V42 rehearsal directory so production remains untouched.


### Production runtime check — 2026-09-20
- Hostinger CLI PHP version: `PHP 8.3.33` (NTS) with Zend OPcache.
- This satisfies the application's Composer requirement (`php ^8.1`) at the runtime version level.


### Production Composer check — 2026-09-20
- Hostinger Composer version: `2.9.8`.
- Composer is running under PHP `8.3.33` from `/opt/alt/php83/usr/bin/php`.


### Production Laravel runtime check — 2026-09-20
Hostinger production runtime currently reports:
- Application: Tag Marketplace
- Laravel: 10.48.29
- PHP: 8.3.33
- Composer: 2.9.8
- Environment: production
- Maintenance mode: OFF
- APP_DEBUG/runtime debug mode: ENABLED

Security/release note:
- Debug mode being enabled in production is a release blocker and should be changed to disabled before the next production deployment.
- Do not change it blindly mid-audit; verify the current server .env values first, then update in a controlled step and clear/rebuild config cache.


### Production debug configuration fix — 2026-09-20
- Confirmed production `.env` had `APP_DEBUG=true`.
- Created a server-side backup: `.env.backup_before_debug_fix`.
- Updated production `.env` to `APP_DEBUG=false`.
- Next step is to rebuild Laravel config cache and verify runtime reports Debug Mode disabled.


### Production debug verification — 2026-09-20
- Rebuilt Laravel config cache after changing production `APP_DEBUG=false`.
- Verified with `php artisan about --only=environment` that runtime Debug Mode is now OFF.
- Production remains out of maintenance mode.


### Production database connectivity check — 2026-09-20
- `php artisan migrate:status` completed successfully on production, confirming Laravel can connect to the configured database.
- Every migration file currently present in the deployed production snapshot is marked Ran.
- The V42 hardening branch contains three newer migration files not present in this production snapshot yet:
  - `2026_06_24_000000_create_cost_calculator_tables.php`
  - `2026_09_20_000000_normalize_growth_offer_learning_index.php`
  - `2026_09_20_235900_scrub_plaintext_provider_secrets.php`
- These must only be applied during the controlled V42 deployment/rehearsal after a database snapshot; do not run them on the current production snapshot now.


### Production env permission hardening — 2026-09-20
- Confirmed production `.env` and the temporary debug-fix backup were mode `644`.
- Changed both to mode `600`.
- Verified owner remains `u637857322`.
- This removes group/other read access from files containing production secrets.


### Production public webroot inspection — 2026-09-20
- `/home/u637857322/domains/tag-marketplace.com/public_html` exists and contains the deployed public assets.
- Visible entries include `index.php`, `.htaccess`, `build/`, `assets/`, `admin/`, `storage/`, and `uploads/`.
- The current deployment uses a split layout: Laravel application code under `laravel_app`, with web-facing public assets under `public_html`.
- Next check: inspect `public_html/index.php` to confirm exactly which Laravel application path it boots.


### Production bootstrap linkage confirmed — 2026-09-20
- `public_html/index.php` requires `../laravel_app/vendor/autoload.php`.
- It boots `../laravel_app/bootstrap/app.php`.
- Therefore the live webroot is explicitly wired to the sibling `laravel_app` directory.
- Any rehearsal must use a separate directory and must not repoint `public_html/index.php` until the release gate is approved.


### Production health check after hardening — 2026-09-20
- After setting `APP_DEBUG=false`, rebuilding config cache, and tightening `.env` permissions, the live site returned `HTTP 200` from `https://tag-marketplace.com`.
- Current production remains healthy after the server-side safety fixes.
- Next phase: prepare a separate V42 rehearsal directory; do not repoint `public_html` or run V42 migrations yet.


### Production Node.js check — 2026-09-20
- `node` is not installed/available in the Hostinger SSH shell.
- This is not a production deploy blocker for the current V42 flow because frontend assets are built in CI and `public/build` is committed/deployed with the application.
- The hardened `deploy.sh` does not require Node/npm on production.
- Do not install Node on the live server solely for deployment unless the deployment strategy changes.
